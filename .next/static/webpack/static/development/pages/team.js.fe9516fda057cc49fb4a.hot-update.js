She completed her Master’s thesis in 2014 on the relationship between vessel traffic and the noise levels received by killer whales. She and her collaborators aimed to figure out what whale’s actually experience at depth by attaching digital acoustic recording tags (Dtags) to them with suction cups. She found that vessel speed was the most important contributor to noise levels received by whales (Houghton et al. 2015). Juliana hopes her findings will allow more boat-based whale-watchers to be as respectful of the whales as possible. Check out a talk that Juliana gave at Seattle’s Town Hall for more information and her current LinkedIn profile to see what she’s up to now. When Juliana is not working, she is spending time with her family. They enjoy boating, beach-combing, hiking, and camping.', './static/images/juliana.jpg', blue);
