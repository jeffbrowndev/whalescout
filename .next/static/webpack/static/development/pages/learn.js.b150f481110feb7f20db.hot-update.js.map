About 13,000 years\r\n            ago, the last glaciers that carved out our majestic mountains had\r\n            finally receded. They left in their wake furrowed land that was rich\r\n            with moisture, glacial sediment, smooth broken stones, and fresh\r\n            cold water that would form our rivers. The abundance of moisture in\r\n            the soil gave birth to the towering trees and native plants that\r\n            shade, filter, stabilize, and oxygenate the riverbeds to this day.\r\n            This protected cold water created the perfect spawning habitat for\r\n            evolving salmonids. For the last 13,000 years, the clean, covered,\r\n            nutritive cold water with large smooth rocks to shelter fertilized\r\n            eggs allowed the first few salmon to evolve into six major\r\n            subspecies numbering into the millions each: Pink, Steelhead, Coho,\r\n            Chum, Sockeye, and the largest of all salmon\r\n            species&nbsp;—&nbsp;Chinook.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/chinook.jpg' />\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The temperate forest ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest developed\r\n            into one giant living biological organism with rivers serving as the\r\n            arteries and veins transporting the red blood cells—salmon—upriver\r\n            where they spawn the next generation of salmon. This giant inland\r\n            organism evolved around the presence of Pacific salmon. Over 200\r\n            species of plants, birds, and mammals (terrestrial and marine alike)\r\n            depend on salmon for survival. Once salmon have reached their\r\n            spawning grounds, bears and eagles pluck adult salmon from the river\r\n            to eat often leaving the nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorous rich\r\n            carcasses behind on the forest floor where they provide nourishment\r\n            to the giant Douglas Firs and Western Hemlock trees. In return,\r\n            these towering trees shade and protect the river making it habitable\r\n            for fish.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/sockeye.jpg' />\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As salmon migrated across the northeast Pacific for thousands of\r\n            years, some of the ocean’s top predators, orcas and pinnipeds,\r\n            evolved with them. Pinnipeds, such as harbor seals and sea lions,\r\n            eat a wide variety of fish aside from salmon including rockfish,\r\n            herring, smelt, and squid. Today, as large numbers of pinnipeds\r\n            inhabit the coastal waters of the north Pacific, one major ecotype\r\n            of orca—known as the transient killer whale—are also flourishing.\r\n            Transient killer whales travel in family pods made up of five or six\r\n            individuals, usually a mother and her offspring. They occasionally\r\n            group together with other pods of orcas, related or not, in order to\r\n            reproduce, socialize, and hunt. The diets of these killer whales\r\n            also include other large whales and porpoises.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />A separate ecotype killer whales thrive off the salmon rich,\r\n            nutrient dense, forest fed waters of what today is known as the\r\n            Salish Sea of Washington and British Columbia. Two distinct\r\n            communities with somewhat overlapping territories exist, Northern\r\n            Residents and Southern Residents. Both rely on salmon—mostly\r\n            Chinook. Southern Residents are the main focus of Whale Scout’s\r\n            programs and are made up of 3 matriarchal family pods (J, K, and L\r\n            pods). Yet a third ecotype of killer whale exists in the Salish Sea:\r\n            offshore killer whales. Rarely seen, these whales are thought to eat\r\n            mostly sharks and as a result have worn-down teeth from the rough\r\n            skin.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className={styles.composition}>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/composition.jpg' />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAgBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAcA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA7EA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
