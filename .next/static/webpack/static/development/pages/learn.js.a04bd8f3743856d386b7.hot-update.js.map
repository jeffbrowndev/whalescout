About 13,000 years\r\n            ago, the last glaciers that carved out our majestic mountains had\r\n            finally receded. They left in their wake furrowed land that was rich\r\n            with moisture, glacial sediment, smooth broken stones, and fresh\r\n            cold water that would form our rivers. The abundance of moisture in\r\n            the soil gave birth to the towering trees and native plants that\r\n            shade, filter, stabilize, and oxygenate the riverbeds to this day.\r\n            This protected cold water created the perfect spawning habitat for\r\n            evolving salmonids. For the last 13,000 years, the clean, covered,\r\n            nutritive cold water with large smooth rocks to shelter fertilized\r\n            eggs allowed the first few salmon to evolve into six major\r\n            subspecies numbering into the millions each: Pink, Steelhead, Coho,\r\n            Chum, Sockeye, and the largest of all salmon\r\n            species&nbsp;—&nbsp;Chinook.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/chinook.jpg' />\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The temperate forest ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest developed\r\n            into one giant living biological organism with rivers serving as the\r\n            arteries and veins transporting the red blood cells—salmon—upriver\r\n            where they spawn the next generation of salmon. This giant inland\r\n            organism evolved around the presence of Pacific salmon. Over 200\r\n            species of plants, birds, and mammals (terrestrial and marine alike)\r\n            depend on salmon for survival. Once salmon have reached their\r\n            spawning grounds, bears and eagles pluck adult salmon from the river\r\n            to eat often leaving the nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorous rich\r\n            carcasses behind on the forest floor where they provide nourishment\r\n            to the giant Douglas Firs and Western Hemlock trees. In return,\r\n            these towering trees shade and protect the river making it habitable\r\n            for fish.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/sockeye.jpg' />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAgBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA9CA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
