var Juliana = new Member('Juliana Houghton', 'Board Member', 'houghtonjuliana@gmail.com', 'Juliana is a graduate of the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. She completed her Master’s thesis in 2014 on the relationship between vessel traffic and the noise levels received by killer whales. She and her collaborators aimed to figure out what whale’s actually experience at depth by attaching digital acoustic recording tags (Dtags) to them with suction cups. She found that vessel speed was the most important contributor to noise levels received by whales (Houghton et al. 2015). Juliana hopes her findings will allow more boat-based whale-watchers to be as respectful of the whales as possible. Check out a talk that Juliana gave at Seattle’s Town Hall for more information and her current LinkedIn profile to see what she’s up to now. When Juliana is not working, she is spending time with her family. They enjoy boating, beach-combing, hiking, and camping.', './static/images/juliana.jpg', red);

var David = new Member('David Bain', 'Program Advisor', 'dbaing17@gmail.com', 'David Bain is a marine mammal biologist and environmental educator who has worked with killer whales for 40 years. “It has become clear to me that improving habitat at the base of the food web is the key to recovering endangered killer whales. To accomplish this, I’ve chosen to complement my research by working with government officials who make decisions that influence the environment on a large scale and educating individuals whose day-to-day decisions add up to determine environmental health. He has a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz, with post-doctoral work at the UC-Davis and the National Marine Mammal Lab in Seattle. He helped develop killer whale recovery strategies in the US and Canada, and the marine-life portion of the Northwest’s oil spill response plan. Dave is president of Cascadia Environmental Science Center and Vice President of Friends of North Creek Forest. He serves on the boards of Sound Action, SnoKing Watershed Council, NaWhare and Orca Conservancy and has been active in the King and Snohomish/Camano ECO Nets.

She was trained as a certified Marine Naturalist through The Whale Museum on San Juan Island. She’s a Clinical Trials Assistant with Seattle Children’s Hospital focusing on Cystic Fibrosis research. When she’s not busy organizing our book club or nose deep in a whale book, she is usually spending time with her family or her corgi Dougan. In the meantime, she likes to horseback ride and read Tolkien books while cuddling her 2 cats. She also enjoys playing video games, going on walks with her husband Sam, or playing her Irish fiddle. You can also find her taking pictures of beautiful PNW scenery; she loves macro photography in particular. She has been interested in whales ever since she was little. Her mom would take her to San Juan Island every summer as a sort of holy pilgrimage. It was the magical chance each year to see orcas.  She’s been fortunate a few times to see our Southern Resident killer whales up close. The spectacular encounters left her inspired and enraptured with them. She can’t remember a time when she wasn’t a passionate advocate for all whales, but especially for our local Southern Resident killer whales.', './static/images/lindsey.jpg', red);
var Ariel = new Member('Ariel Yseth', 'Newsletter Editor and Podcast Producer', 'Ariel@whalescout.org', 'Ariel is originally from eastern South Dakota but has always had the Pacific Northwest in her heart.  She first fell in love with our Southern Resident Killer Whales at the age of two when J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny appeared in the opening sequence of the movie Free Willy. Between her junior and senior year of college, Ariel got her first taste of the PNW when she worked at a summer camp on Orcas Island, WA, in 2012. She moved to Lynnwood, WA, in fall 2013 and began working as a registered nurse on the organ transplant unit at Swedish Hospital in downtown Seattle. She completed the Marine Naturalist Training Program in the fall of 2015 and has since spent hundreds of hours on the shores of the Salish Sea educating the public about our killer whales. In the summertime, Ariel can most often be found wandering the trails of American Camp, San Juan Island. Her favorite activity involves dragging her friends and family on camping trips to the San Juan’s to see the whales. Ariel also loves kayaking (if you meet her be sure to ask about her folding kayak), photography, and considers herself to be a movie buff. You can bet that so long as the activity has something to do with whales or the sea, Ariel loves it.
