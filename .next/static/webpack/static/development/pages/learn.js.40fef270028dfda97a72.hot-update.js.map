About 13,000 years\r\n            ago, the last glaciers that carved out our majestic mountains had\r\n            finally receded. They left in their wake furrowed land that was rich\r\n            with moisture, glacial sediment, smooth broken stones, and fresh\r\n            cold water that would form our rivers. The abundance of moisture in\r\n            the soil gave birth to the towering trees and native plants that\r\n            shade, filter, stabilize, and oxygenate the riverbeds to this day.\r\n            This protected cold water created the perfect spawning habitat for\r\n            evolving salmonids. For the last 13,000 years, the clean, covered,\r\n            nutritive cold water with large smooth rocks to shelter fertilized\r\n            eggs allowed the first few salmon to evolve into six major\r\n            subspecies numbering into the millions each: Pink, Steelhead, Coho,\r\n            Chum, Sockeye, and the largest of all salmon\r\n            species&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;Chinook.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/chinook.jpg' />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA5BA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
