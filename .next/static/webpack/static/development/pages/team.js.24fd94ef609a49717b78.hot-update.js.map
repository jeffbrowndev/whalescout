She completed her Master’s thesis in 2014 on the relationship between vessel traffic and the noise levels received by killer whales. She and her collaborators aimed to figure out what whale’s actually experience at depth by attaching digital acoustic recording tags (Dtags) to them with suction cups. She found that vessel speed was the most important contributor to noise levels received by whales (Houghton et al. 2015). Juliana hopes her findings will allow more boat-based whale-watchers to be as respectful of the whales as possible. Check out a talk that Juliana gave at Seattle’s Town Hall for more information and her current LinkedIn profile to see what she’s up to now.

To accomplish this, I’ve chosen to complement my research by working with government officials who make decisions that influence the environment on a large scale and educating individuals whose day-to-day decisions add up to determine environmental health.
