Volunteers facilitate land-based whale\r\n            watching experiences offering the public opportunities to connect\r\n            and learn about whales for free in a manner that does not contribute\r\n            to underwater noise. Our educational programs, stewardship messages,\r\n            and salmon habitat restoration efforts address two other threats to\r\n            Southern Resident killer whales: lack of prey and toxins. Our team\r\n            of volunteers is distributed throughout Puget Sound from Olympia to\r\n            San Juan Island creating a regional network of on-the-ground orca\r\n            and salmon educators and advocates.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <h3>Volunteer Programs</h3>\r\n          <h4>\r\n            1. Land-based whale watching in Puget Sound and on San Juan Island\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <u>Puget Sound</u> - Volunteers station themselves at public beaches\r\n            on the shorelines of Puget Sound both opportunistically when whales\r\n            are reported in the area and at scheduled times, the second Sunday\r\n            of the month, and at special events.{\" \"}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <u>San Juan Island</u> - Whale Scout is a partner in the San Juan\r\n            Island Naturalist Program where volunteers are stationed at the\r\n            Westside Preserve to provide information about whales, the Salish\r\n            Sea, and the unique coastal prairie ecosystem found at the site.\r\n            Summer months only.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>2. Education and outreach</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Throughout the year, Whale Scout attends community events and fairs,\r\n            visits classrooms and other small groups. We offer educational\r\n            programming and activities that share information about whales,\r\n            salmon, and the importance of habitat. Our family felt board\r\n            activity offers a unique way for kids to understand stewardship\r\n            actions and how they connect to the larger ecosystem.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>3. Habitat restoration</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Whale Scout offers twelve “Helpin’ Out” events each year. We work to\r\n            restore native vegetation and natural processes along rivers,\r\n            streams, shorelines, and forests that provide critical habitat for\r\n            salmon and forage fish. Activities at these events usually includes\r\n            removal of invasive plants, installing native trees and shrubs, and\r\n            removing litter from beaches. We recommend that all volunteers try\r\n            to attend 1-2 events each year and play a role in these events.\r\n            People of all abilities are able to play a role in the success of\r\n            these events from signing people in, to providing snacks, taking\r\n            photos, or assisting with the planning process.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>4. Administration</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            There are many opportunities to help with the everyday functioning\r\n            of our organization. Activities include helping with mailing,\r\n            fundraising, communication, graphic design, organization, etc.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <EventSlider events={props.events} />\r\n      <div className={styles.article_container}>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <h3>Volunteer Expectations</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <u>Time commitment</u> - We ask that volunteers commit to an average\r\n            of 2 hours per month or 24 hours per year of service in any program\r\n            or combination of programs. We also ask that volunteers commit to\r\n            attending at least one training session per year.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <h3>Volunteer Benefits</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Volunteers are given opportunities to make a difference for the\r\n            whales, fish and wildlife, and communities whom share the Salish Sea\r\n            ecosystem. Through our continuing education programs (training\r\n            sessions, field trips, book club) volunteers are also the chance to\r\n            learn more about marine mammals of the Salish Sea, the issues they\r\n            face, and creative solutions to aid in the recovery of endangered\r\n            species. Volunteers promote change in their community by helping\r\n            others watch whales from shore, and encouraging people to channel\r\n            their interest in whales into stewardship actions such as engaging\r\n            in habitat restoration. Working with the public, volunteers develop\r\n            skills in interpretation in communication. Many also learn to\r\n            identify whale pods and individuals, and interpret scientific\r\n            findings.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className={styles.perks}>\r\n        <div className={styles.perks_top}>\r\n          <Perk\r\n            src={`${db}/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/book.svg`}\r\n            title=\"Whale Scout Book Club\"\r\n            src={`${db}/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/book.svg`}\r\n            description=\"Join our group to read and discuss books about a variety of topics related to whales, Puget Sound, science, etc. We meet about every three months on Saturdays at McMenamins in Bothell.
