About 13,000 years\r\n            ago, the last glaciers that carved out our majestic mountains had\r\n            finally receded. They left in their wake furrowed land that was rich\r\n            with moisture, glacial sediment, smooth broken stones, and fresh\r\n            cold water that would form our rivers. The abundance of moisture in\r\n            the soil gave birth to the towering trees and native plants that\r\n            shade, filter, stabilize, and oxygenate the riverbeds to this day.\r\n            This protected cold water created the perfect spawning habitat for\r\n            evolving salmonids. For the last 13,000 years, the clean, covered,\r\n            nutritive cold water with large smooth rocks to shelter fertilized\r\n            eggs allowed the first few salmon to evolve into six major\r\n            subspecies numbering into the millions each: Pink, Steelhead, Coho,\r\n            Chum, Sockeye, and the largest of all salmon\r\n            species&nbsp;—&nbsp;Chinook.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/chinook.jpg' />\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The temperate forest ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest developed\r\n            into one giant living biological organism with rivers serving as the\r\n            arteries and veins transporting the red blood cells—salmon—upriver\r\n            where they spawn the next generation of salmon. This giant inland\r\n            organism evolved around the presence of Pacific salmon. Over 200\r\n            species of plants, birds, and mammals (terrestrial and marine alike)\r\n            depend on salmon for survival. Once salmon have reached their\r\n            spawning grounds, bears and eagles pluck adult salmon from the river\r\n            to eat often leaving the nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorous rich\r\n            carcasses behind on the forest floor where they provide nourishment\r\n            to the giant Douglas Firs and Western Hemlock trees. In return,\r\n            these towering trees shade and protect the river making it habitable\r\n            for fish.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img src='./static/images/learn_images/sockeye.jpg' />\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As salmon migrated across the northeast Pacific for thousands of\r\n            years, some of the ocean’s top predators, orcas and pinnipeds,\r\n            evolved with them. Pinnipeds, such as harbor seals and sea lions,\r\n            eat a wide variety of fish aside from salmon including rockfish,\r\n            herring, smelt, and squid. Today, as large numbers of pinnipeds\r\n            inhabit the coastal waters of the north Pacific, one major ecotype\r\n            of orca—known as the transient killer whale—are also flourishing.\r\n            Transient killer whales travel in family pods made up of five or six\r\n            individuals, usually a mother and her offspring. They occasionally\r\n            group together with other pods of orcas, related or not, in order to\r\n            reproduce, socialize, and hunt. The diets of these killer whales\r\n            also include other large whales and porpoises.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />A separate ecotype killer whales thrive off the salmon rich,\r\n            nutrient dense, forest fed waters of what today is known as the\r\n            Salish Sea of Washington and British Columbia. Two distinct\r\n            communities with somewhat overlapping territories exist, Northern\r\n            Residents and Southern Residents. Both rely on salmon—mostly\r\n            Chinook. Southern Residents are the main focus of Whale Scout’s\r\n            programs and are made up of 3 matriarchal family pods (J, K, and L\r\n            pods). Yet a third ecotype of killer whale exists in the Salish Sea:\r\n            offshore killer whales. Rarely seen, these whales are thought to eat\r\n            mostly sharks and as a result have worn-down teeth from the rough\r\n            skin.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Composition />\r\n      <div className={styles.article_container}>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over the last 150 years, Europeans developed the Salish Sea\r\n            watershed for large-scale human habitation. We didn’t understand how\r\n            our actions would alter the life of the majestic forest and sea\r\n            surrounding us. Forests were cleared, beaches were walled up, and\r\n            rivers were dammed to allow western civilization to flourish.\r\n            Commercial fisheries were established to bolster the economy and the\r\n            orcas were seen as vicious, voracious fishing competition. Our\r\n            western scientific understanding of killer whales was non-existent.\r\n            Out of fear and misunderstanding, humans shot to kill orcas as\r\n            recently as the 1960s. <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Beginning in the early 1960s, the marine park and aquarium industry\r\n            was booming and began to target killer whales in Puget Sound.\r\n            Capture teams patrolled Puget Sound by air and boat searching for\r\n            orcas. When a pod was located, the teams chased the whales into\r\n            coves, often detonating underwater seal bombs to disorient and\r\n            frighten them making it easier to corral the group into a net pen\r\n            and separate and remove the calves to be sold for captivity. It is\r\n            unknown exactly how many whales were taken, but federal estimates\r\n            put the number at around 50 individuals—mainly Southern Resident J\r\n            and L pod individuals. Only one of the captured Southern Residents,\r\n            named “Lolita” from L pod is alive today and is currently on display\r\n            at the Miami Seaquarium.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img src='./static/images/learn_images/captured.jpg' />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In 1976, the horrific capture of a transient orca pod (including the\r\n            still wild-living matriarch T46) at Budd Inlet was witnessed by\r\n            Ralph Munro who, at the time, was an aid to Washington Governor\r\n            Evans. Motivated by the horror of what he saw, the capture process\r\n            was later outlawed in the state of Washington. As a result, the\r\n            federal government hired biologists to study, count, and track local\r\n            orca populations. Scientists, such as Ken Balcomb with the Center\r\n            for Whale Research on San Juan Island, began to unravel vibrant\r\n            lives and cultures of the Salish Sea orcas and our fear of these\r\n            northwest icons was replaced with awe. <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            As the Center for Whale Research continued monitoring the orca\r\n            population, they discovered that resident population numbers\r\n            mirrored that of the salmon returns. In years when the salmon runs\r\n            were strong, the resident orca population boomed. When the salmon\r\n            runs were weak, more resident whales died. In 2005, the Southern\r\n            Resident killer whale population were listed as endangered under the\r\n            Endangered Species Act following a precipitous in numbers. Today,\r\n            Southern Resident killer whales number fewer than when they were\r\n            listed as endangered, a disappointing trend. The main cause of this\r\n            decline is a lack of&nbsp;salmon.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img src='./static/images/learn_images/graph.jpg' />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A well-fed orca has a thick layer of fat, also known as blubber.\r\n            Aside from providing buoyancy and body heat control, the blubber\r\n            layer is where an orca stores ingested pollutants. As top predators\r\n            with long lives, any pollutants in the water (PCBs, DDT, flame\r\n            retardants, etc.) bioaccumulate at the upper levels of the food\r\n            chain. Well fed orcas store the pollutants in their blubber layer\r\n            where their side effects are minimal. The transient orcas of the\r\n            Salish Sea have an abundant supply of pinnipeds and other marine\r\n            mammals to feed upon and therefore are able to keep toxins stored\r\n            away in their blubber. The Southern Residents, despite eating lower\r\n            on the food chain (marine mammals vs. salmon) are more at risk to\r\n            toxin exposure since they are metabolizing their blubber stores\r\n            burning fat during times of low salmon abundance. These toxins are\r\n            proven to disrupt immune and reproductive systems. Compounding these\r\n            issues are vessel impacts. Underwater noise disrupts the whale’s\r\n            echolocation and communication and the presence of boats has been\r\n            linked with behavior changes.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Threats />\r\n      <div className={styles.article_container}>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <p>\r\n            To recover these endangered Southern Resident killer whales we must\r\n            address these three main threats. Whale Scout’s programs address\r\n            each one and provide ways for you to get involved. First, we offer\r\n            ways to watch whales from shore without leaving any trace on our\r\n            waters.(hyperlink to watch section) Second, we help limit toxins\r\n            from entering our waterways. We offer suggestions each month to\r\n            become better stewards of the environment which add up to help the\r\n            whales. (hyperlink? To the monthly list of actions on the back of\r\n            the “save orcas” brochure? Direct elsewhere to that info on the\r\n            site?) Our “Helpin’ Out” events (link to Helpin’ Out event listing)\r\n            also limit toxins from entering our waterways through the natural\r\n            treatment of stormwater runoff. At these events we plant trees and\r\n            work to restore ecological function along salmon rivers, streams,\r\n            and nearshore habitats. This provides salmon more places to live,\r\n            spawn, and thrive. The more salmon there are, the more food killer\r\n            whales have to eat. No matter where you live, you can make a\r\n            difference with PodMatch (link) through your donations or\r\n            participation with groups throughout the west coast. <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            We must keep in mind that we’re striving for intact ecosystems from\r\n            the treetops to the outer coast. Not only will the whales benefit\r\n            from resilient forests, rivers and streams, everyone else will too,\r\n            including us. The work we do restoring salmon habitat results in\r\n            cleaner water, air, and more salmon for everyone.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={styles.article_section}>\r\n          <h1>\r\n            What’s the Connection Between Planting Trees and Saving Whales?\r\n          </h1>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAgBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAcA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAcA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAqBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAzLA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
