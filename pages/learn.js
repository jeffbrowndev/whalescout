          <p>
            To better understand the relationship the Southern Resident orcas
            have with salmon, we need to travel back in time. About 13,000 years
            ago, the last glaciers that carved out our majestic mountains had
            finally receded. They left in their wake furrowed land that was rich
            with moisture, glacial sediment, smooth broken stones, and fresh
            cold water that would form our rivers. The abundance of moisture in
            the soil gave birth to the towering trees and native plants that
            shade, filter, stabilize, and oxygenate the riverbeds to this day.
            This protected cold water created the perfect spawning habitat for
            evolving salmonids. For the last 13,000 years, the clean, covered,
            nutritive cold water with large smooth rocks to shelter fertilized
            eggs allowed the first few salmon to evolve into six major
            subspecies numbering into the millions each: Pink, Steelhead, Coho,
            Chum, Sockeye, and the largest of all salmon
            species&nbsp;—&nbsp;Chinook.

            The temperate forest ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest developed
            into one giant living biological organism with rivers serving as the
            arteries and veins transporting the red blood cells—salmon—upriver
            where they spawn the next generation of salmon. This giant inland
            organism evolved around the presence of Pacific salmon. Over 200
            species of plants, birds, and mammals (terrestrial and marine alike)
            depend on salmon for survival. Once salmon have reached their
            spawning grounds, bears and eagles pluck adult salmon from the river
            to eat often leaving the nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorous rich
            carcasses behind on the forest floor where they provide nourishment
            to the giant Douglas Firs and Western Hemlock trees. In return,
            these towering trees shade and protect the river making it habitable
            for fish.

            As salmon migrated across the northeast Pacific for thousands of
            years, some of the ocean’s top predators, orcas and pinnipeds,
            evolved with them. Pinnipeds, such as harbor seals and sea lions,
            eat a wide variety of fish aside from salmon including rockfish,
            herring, smelt, and squid. Today, as large numbers of pinnipeds
            inhabit the coastal waters of the north Pacific, one major ecotype
            of orca—known as the transient killer whale—are also flourishing.
            Transient killer whales travel in family pods made up of five or six
            individuals, usually a mother and her offspring. They occasionally
            group together with other pods of orcas, related or not, in order to
            reproduce, socialize, and hunt. The diets of these killer whales
            also include other large whales and porpoises.
            <br />
            <br />A separate ecotype killer whales thrive off the salmon rich,
            nutrient dense, forest fed waters of what today is known as the
            Salish Sea of Washington and British Columbia. Two distinct
            communities with somewhat overlapping territories exist, Northern
            Residents and Southern Residents. Both rely on salmon—mostly
            Chinook. Southern Residents are the main focus of Whale Scout’s
            programs and are made up of 3 matriarchal family pods (J, K, and L
            pods). Yet a third ecotype of killer whale exists in the Salish Sea:
            offshore killer whales. Rarely seen, these whales are thought to eat
            mostly sharks and as a result have worn-down teeth from the rough
            skin.

          <p>
            Over the last 150 years, Europeans developed the Salish Sea
            watershed for large-scale human habitation. We didn’t understand how
            our actions would alter the life of the majestic forest and sea
            surrounding us. Forests were cleared, beaches were walled up, and
            rivers were dammed to allow western civilization to flourish.
            Commercial fisheries were established to bolster the economy and the
            orcas were seen as vicious, voracious fishing competition. Our
            western scientific understanding of killer whales was non-existent.
            Out of fear and misunderstanding, humans shot to kill orcas as
            recently as the 1960s. <br />
            <br />
            Beginning in the early 1960s, the marine park and aquarium industry
            was booming and began to target killer whales in Puget Sound.
            Capture teams patrolled Puget Sound by air and boat searching for
            orcas. When a pod was located, the teams chased the whales into
            coves, often detonating underwater seal bombs to disorient and
            frighten them making it easier to corral the group into a net pen
            and separate and remove the calves to be sold for captivity. It is
            unknown exactly how many whales were taken, but federal estimates
            put the number at around 50 individuals—mainly Southern Resident J
            and L pod individuals. Only one of the captured Southern Residents,
            named “Lolita” from L pod is alive today and is currently on display
            at the Miami Seaquarium.

            In 1976, the horrific capture of a transient orca pod (including the
            still wild-living matriarch T46) at Budd Inlet was witnessed by
            Ralph Munro who, at the time, was an aid to Washington Governor
            Evans. Motivated by the horror of what he saw, the capture process
            was later outlawed in the state of Washington. As a result, the
            federal government hired biologists to study, count, and track local
            orca populations. Scientists, such as Ken Balcomb with the Center
            for Whale Research on San Juan Island, began to unravel vibrant
            lives and cultures of the Salish Sea orcas and our fear of these
            northwest icons was replaced with awe. <br />
            <br />
            As the Center for Whale Research continued monitoring the orca
            population, they discovered that resident population numbers
            mirrored that of the salmon returns. In years when the salmon runs
            were strong, the resident orca population boomed. When the salmon
            runs were weak, more resident whales died. In 2005, the Southern
            Resident killer whale population were listed as endangered under the
            Endangered Species Act following a precipitous in numbers. Today,
            Southern Resident killer whales number fewer than when they were
            listed as endangered, a disappointing trend. The main cause of this
            decline is a lack of&nbsp;salmon.

            A well-fed orca has a thick layer of fat, also known as blubber.
            Aside from providing buoyancy and body heat control, the blubber
            layer is where an orca stores ingested pollutants. As top predators
            with long lives, any pollutants in the water (PCBs, DDT, flame
            retardants, etc.) bioaccumulate at the upper levels of the food
            chain. Well fed orcas store the pollutants in their blubber layer
            where their side effects are minimal. The transient orcas of the
            Salish Sea have an abundant supply of pinnipeds and other marine
            mammals to feed upon and therefore are able to keep toxins stored
            away in their blubber. The Southern Residents, despite eating lower
            on the food chain (marine mammals vs. salmon) are more at risk to
            toxin exposure since they are metabolizing their blubber stores
            burning fat during times of low salmon abundance. These toxins are
            proven to disrupt immune and reproductive systems. Compounding these
            issues are vessel impacts. Underwater noise disrupts the whale’s
            echolocation and communication and the presence of boats has been
            linked with behavior changes.

            To recover these endangered Southern Resident killer whales we must
            address these three main threats. Whale Scout’s programs address
            each one and provide ways for you to get involved. First, we offer
            ways to watch whales from shore without leaving any trace on our
            waters.(hyperlink to watch section) Second, we help limit toxins
            from entering our waterways. We offer suggestions each month to
            become better stewards of the environment which add up to help the
            whales. (hyperlink? To the monthly list of actions on the back of
            the “save orcas” brochure? Direct elsewhere to that info on the
            site?) Our “Helpin’ Out” events (link to Helpin’ Out event listing)
            also limit toxins from entering our waterways through the natural
            treatment of stormwater runoff. At these events we plant trees and
            work to restore ecological function along salmon rivers, streams,
            and nearshore habitats. This provides salmon more places to live,
            spawn, and thrive. The more salmon there are, the more food killer
            whales have to eat. No matter where you live, you can make a
            difference with PodMatch (link) through your donations or
            participation with groups throughout the west coast. <br />
            <br />
            We must keep in mind that we’re striving for intact ecosystems from
            the treetops to the outer coast. Not only will the whales benefit
            from resilient forests, rivers and streams, everyone else will too,
            including us. The work we do restoring salmon habitat results in
            cleaner water, air, and more salmon for everyone.
            <br />
            <br />
            Southern Resident killer whales have a broad range from Southeast
            Alaska to to Monterey, California. Some of these west coast rivers
            extend hundreds of miles inland crossing the backyards and
            neighborhoods in major population centers. Unfortunately, many of
            these populations of salmon are also threatened or endangered.

          <p>
            A significant amount of time spent a volunteer work parties or our
            “Helpin’ Out” events are spent restoring the “riparian zone” or
            vegetation immediately along salmon rivers and streams. You may ask,
            “Why is this important, and how does it help?” Well, with the help
            of our friends at the Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group, we came up
            with a fun way to remember: 6 C's Thanks to Trees!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Cool </strong>- Trees shade the water keeping it cool in
            warm months
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Clean </strong>- Vegetation and root systems filter toxins
            in rain runoff before entering into waterways
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Clear </strong>- Complex root systems hold the banks of
            rivers and streams preventing erosion which can smother salmon eggs
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Constant </strong>- Consistently flowing waters are critical
            for salmon. Rushes and low drops in water levels don’t allow fish to
            move where they need to go or can scour out eggs embedded in
            streambeds. Rain is slowed down by tree branches and is stored in
            the ground beneath trees to slowly be released into the main
            channel.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Critters </strong>- The tiny bugs that baby salmon need to
            eat live on native vegetation. This gives the orca’s food’s food a
            place to thrive!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Cover </strong>- Towering trees and fallen logs offer adult
            migrating salmon some protection and refuge from predators such as
            birds who may be lurking above.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Many of our Helpin' Out events are supported by The Nature
            Conservancy. Planting trees in our cities helps our orcas because of
            the reasons above and to specifically reduce toxic stormwater which
            is harmful for salmon, orcas, and all of us.
